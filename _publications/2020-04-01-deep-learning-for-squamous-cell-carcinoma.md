excerpt: 'The purpose of this abstract is to describe the application of deep learning to digital histopathology slide data for detection of clinically relevant features. Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence which can process graphical data and “learn” to extract hidden features. Here we test the ability of deep learning to detect human papilloma virus, location of origin, and other features.'
