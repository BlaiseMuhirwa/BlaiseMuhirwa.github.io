Hi there! 

I am currently working as an AI Engineer at [ThirdAI](https://thirdai.com) where I mostly work on a 
variety of machine learning and engineering problems. Prior to that, I was a student at
The University of Chicago where I double-majored in Computer Science and Computational and Applied Mathematics. I was fortunate enough to be advised by Professor [Rebecca Willet](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/) and to work with Professor [Raul Castro Fernandez](https://raulcastrofernandez.com/). 

My research interests, broadly defined, are in **statistical machine learning** and **natural language processing**. For instance, the problem of [embedding recycling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04993.pdf) is of particular interest to me, as is the ability to exhibit provable theoretical guarantees for state-of-the-art machine learning methods, such as the attention mechanism--the latter of which is best exemplified by the work of [Vukcovic et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02876.pdf).
